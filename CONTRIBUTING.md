# Contributing guide for TCD XIOS2 Extras

This is an internal mirror of XIOS2, this is not a divergent fork of the XIOS2 code base. (see README.md)

Issues are corralled and managed here and prototype development prepared and tested. Please consider how prototypes may be targeted at the core XIOS code base in future.

1. Steps for creating good issues or pull requests:
    * these should be issues with XIOS2,
    * links to source code help,
    * use cases for problems help,
    * demonstration code is useful, consider linking to TCD-XIOS-demonstration
1. Community and behavioral expectations.
    * Feature branches are used to manage prototype development effort
    * new features should not be targeted at the `main` branch in this repository.
    * code changes proposed should be contained in Pull Requests, from contributor github forks
        * no `changes requested` on PR
        * at least one MO reviewer involved & approves
            * & all MO reviewers listed as approved
        * no pending reviews outstanding
        * an MO reviewer to merge, 
            * proposer should not merge
